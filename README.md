COVID-19 Analysis SQL Project

Introduction
This project encompasses a series of SQL queries designed to analyze COVID-19 data. The queries aim to extract valuable insights from datasets containing information such as total cases, total deaths, population, vaccinations, and more.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide comprehensive analysis and understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic through SQL queries. The analysis includes examining total cases, total deaths, infection rates, vaccination rates, and other pertinent metrics.

Data Exploration
The datasets used for this project include:

coviddeaths: Contains information about COVID-19 cases and deaths by location and date.
covidvaccinations: Provides data on COVID-19 vaccinations by location and date.
Queries Overview
Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Compares total cases and total deaths to calculate the death percentage for a specific location, such as India.
Total Cases vs. Population: Calculates the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 for a specific location, such as India.
Countries with Highest Infection Rate: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
Countries with Highest Death Count: Lists countries with the highest death counts due to COVID-19.
Continents with Highest Death Count: Highlights continents with the highest death counts from COVID-19.
Global Numbers: Provides global statistics on total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage.
Population vs. Vaccination: Analyzes the relationship between population and vaccination rates, including the percentage of vaccinated people.
Population vs. Vaccination (Temp Table Method): Utilizes temporary tables to perform the same analysis as the previous query.
Usage
These SQL queries can be executed in SQL environments such as MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, or any other SQL-compatible tool. Users can modify the queries as needed to analyze specific regions, timeframes, or metrics of interest.

Conclusion
The COVID-19 analysis SQL project offers valuable insights into the impact of the pandemic worldwide. By leveraging SQL queries, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of the spread of the virus, vaccination efforts, and other critical aspects related to COVID-19.
